## My process

This project is build with Next.js and Styled Components. The REST Countries API was used to fetch the data.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup - as much as possible
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - API for fetching data
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Working and optimizing images isn't always as easy and straight forward. This project was a good opportunity to learn more about it. I learned a lot about NextJS Image component. However, I didn't use it to its full potential. I will come back and improve this project once I learn more about it.

### Continued development

- This application is built on Next.js and Styled Components. I want to continue learning and improving my skills in these technologies. I want to learn more about the best practices and how to optimize the application. The data fetching utilizes Server Side Generation SSG. I figured as I learn this deeper I will come back and improve and iterate on this project. Once NextJS 13 is stable I will migrate the project to it.

### Useful resources

- [Flickering issue](https://www.stackfive.io/work/nextjs/how-to-fix-styled-components-page-flicker-in-next-js-12) - This article is used to fix the flickering issue when using styled-components in Next.js 12+. The main issue was that the styles were being rendered on the server and then on the client. This caused the flickering issue.
